# Transport Monitoring System for School Kids Safety

Many kids die in school buses on their way to/from the school/home. The drivers mostly forget them unintentionally to drop them, or may be the kid has slept without being noticed by the driver. Parents do not know where their kid is and it is too late when they realize that the kid is not in the school or in the bus. This is where the problem arises; “Transport Monitoring System for School Kids Safety” is a novel system that allows parents and the school management to monitor kids’ status and to convey it to the responsible people (Parents/School) about their whereabouts.
